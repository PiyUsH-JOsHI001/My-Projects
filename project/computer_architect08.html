    <h1 id="Computer Registers">Computer Registers</h1>
    <p>Registers are a type of computer memory used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that
        are being used immediately by the CPU. The registers used by the CPU are often termed as Processor registers.
        <br>
        <br>
        A processor register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any data (such as bit sequence or individual
        characters).
        <br>
        <br>
        The computer needs processor registers for manipulating data and a register for holding a memory address. The
        register holding the memory location is used to calculate the address of the next instruction after the
        execution of the current instruction is completed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following is the list of some of the most common registers used in a basic computer:

    <ul>
        <li>The Memory unit has a capacity of 4096 words, and each word contains 16 bits.
            The Data Register (DR) contains 16 bits which hold the operand read from the memory location.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Memory Address Register (MAR) contains 12 bits which hold the address for the memory location.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Program Counter (PC) also contains 12 bits which hold the address of the next instruction to be read
            from memory after the current instruction is executed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Accumulator (AC) register is a general purpose processing register.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The instruction read from memory is placed in the Instruction register (IR).</li>

        <li>The Output Registers (OR) holds the output after processing the input data.</li>
