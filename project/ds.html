        <p>
            Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every
            enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. This tutorial will
            give you a great understanding on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level
            applications and need of algorithms, and data structures.</p>

        <h3> Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?</h3>
        <p>As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face
            now-a-days.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Data Search −</b> Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to
                search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As
                data grows, search will become slower.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Processor speed −</b> Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to
                billion records.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Multiple requests −</b> As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even
                the fast server fails while searching the data.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>

        <p> To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data
            structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be
            searched almost instantly.</p>

        <h3> Applications of Data Structure and Algorithms</h3>
        <p> Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order
            to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an
            algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.</p>

        <p>From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Search −</b> Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Sort −</b> Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Insert − </b>Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Update −</b> Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.</li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Delete −</b> Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>

        <p>The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures −</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fibonacci number series</li>
            <br>
            <li>Knapsack problem</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tower of Hanoi</li>
            <br>
            <li>All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall</li>
            <br>
            <li>Shortest path by Dijkstra</li>
            <br>
            <li>Project scheduling</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
