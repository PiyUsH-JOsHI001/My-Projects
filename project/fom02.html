            Major differences between management and administration are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Meaning:</b> Management is a systematic way of managing people and things within the organisation.
                The administration is defined as an act of administering the whole organisation by a group of people.
            </li>
            <li><b>Level:</b> Management is an activity of business and functional level, whereas Administration is a
                high-level activity. </li>
            <li><b>Focus:</b> Management focuses on policy implementation, policy formulation is performed by the
                administration. </li>
            <li><b>Functions: </b>of administration include legislation and determination. Functions of management are
                executive and governing. </li>
            <li><b>Type of decision:</b> Administration takes all the important decisions of the organisation while
                management makes decisions under the boundaries set by the administration. </li>
            <li><b>People:</b> A group of persons, who are employees of the organisation, is collectively known as
                management. On the other hand, administration represents the owners of the organisation. </li>
            <li><b>Type of Organisation:</b> Management can be seen in the profit making organisation like business
                enterprises. Conversely, the Administration is found in government and military offices, clubs,
