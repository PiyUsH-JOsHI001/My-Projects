    <ul>
        <li>The primary function of a computer system is to execute a program, sequence of instructions. These
            instructions are stored in computer memory.</li>
        <br>
        <li>These instructions are executed to process data which are already loaded in the computer memory through some
            input devices.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After processing the data, the result is either stored in the memory for further reference, or it is sent to
            the outside world through some output port.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To perform the execution of an instruction, in addition to the arithmetic logic unit, and control unit, the
            processor contains a number of registers used for temporary storage of data and some special function
            registers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The special function registers include program counters (PC), instruction registers (IR), memory address
            registers (MAR) and memory and memory data registers (MDR).</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Program counter is one of the most critical registers in CPU.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Program counter monitors the execution of instructions. It keeps track on which instruction is being
            executed and what the next instruction will be.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The instruction register IR is used to hold the instruction that is currently being executed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The contents of IR are available to the control unit, which generate the timing signals that control, the
            various processing elements involved in executing the instruction.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The two registers MAR and MDR are used to handle the data transfer between the main memory and the
            processor.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The MAR holds the address of the main memory to or from which data is to be transferred.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The MDR contains the data to be written into or read from the addressed word of the main memory.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whenever the processor is asked to communicate with devices, we say that the processor is servicing the
            devices. The processor can service these devices in one of the two ways.</li>
        <br>
        <li>One way is to use the polling routine, and the other way is to use an interrupt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Polling enables the processor software to check each of the input and output devices frequently. During this
            check, the processor tests to see if any devices need servicing or not.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Interrupt method provides an external asynchronous input that informs the processor that it should complete
            whatever instruction that is currently being executed and fetch a new routine that will service the
            requesting device.</li>
