        <p>
            It may be easy to confuse the terms “data science” and “business intelligence” (BI) because they both relate
            to an organization’s data and analysis of that data, but they do differ in focus.
            <br>
            <br>
            Business intelligence (BI) is typically an umbrella term for the technology that enables data preparation,
            data mining, data management, and data visualization. Business intelligence tools and processes allow end
            users to identify actionable information from raw data, facilitating data-driven decision-making within
            organizations across various industries. While data science tools overlap in much of this regard, business
            intelligence focuses more on data from the past, and the insights from BI tools are more descriptive in
            nature. It uses data to understand what happened before to inform a course of action. BI is geared toward
            static (unchanging) data that is usually structured. While data science uses descriptive data, it typically
            utilizes it to determine predictive variables, which are then used to categorize data or to make forecasts
            <br>
            <br>
            Data science and BI are not mutually exclusive—digitally savvy organizations use both to fully understand
            and extract value from their data.
