    <p>
        The term <b>Stored Program Control Concept</b> refers to the storage of instructions in computer memory to enable it to perform a variety of tasks in sequence or intermittently.
        <br>
        <br>
        The idea was introduced in the late 1040s by John von Neumann who proposed that a program be electronically stored in the binary-number format in a memory device so that instructions could be modified by the computer as determined by intermediate computational results.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) </b> the first computing system designed in the early 1940s. It was based on Stored Program Concept in which machine use memory for processing data.

    <h4>Stored Program Concept can be further classified in three basic ways:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Von-Neumann Model</li>
        <br>
        <li>General Purpose System</li>
        <br>
        <li>Parallel Processing</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
