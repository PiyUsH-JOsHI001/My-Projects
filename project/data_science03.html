        <p>Data scientists rely on popular programming languages to conduct exploratory data analysis and statistical
            regression. These open source tools support pre-built statistical modeling, machine learning, and graphics
            capabilities. These languages include the following (read more at "Python vs. R: What's the Difference?"):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>R Studio:</b> An open source programming language and environment for developing statistical
                computing and graphics.</li>
            <li><b>Python:</b> It is a dynamic and flexible programming language. The Python includes numerous
                libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, for analyzing data quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To facilitate sharing code and other information, data scientists may use GitHub and Jupyter notebooks.
            <br>
            <br>

            Some data scientists may prefer a user interface, and two common enterprise tools for statistical analysis
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SAS:</b></li> A comprehensive tool suite, including visualizations and interactive dashboards, for
            analyzing, reporting, data mining, and predictive modeling.</li>
            <li><b>IBM SPSS:</b></li> Offers advanced statistical analysis, a large library of machine learning
            algorithms, text analysis, open source extensibility, integration with big data, and seamless deployment
            into applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data scientists also gain proficiency in using big data processing platforms, such as Apache Spark, the open
            source framework Apache Hadoop, and NoSQL databases. They are also skilled with a wide range of data
            visualization tools, including simple graphics tools included with business presentation and spreadsheet
            applications (like Microsoft Excel), built-for-purpose commercial visualization tools like Tableau and IBM
            Cognos, and open source tools like D3.js (a JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations)
            and RAW Graphs. For building machine learning models, data scientists frequently turn to several frameworks
            like PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, and Spark MLib.

            Given the steep learning curve in data science, many companies are seeking to accelerate their return on
            investment for AI projects; they often struggle to hire the talent needed to realize data science project’s
            full potential. To address this gap, they are turning to multipersona data science and machine learning
            (DSML) platforms, giving rise to the role of “citizen data scientist.”
            <br>
            <br>

            Multipersona DSML platforms use automation, self-service portals, and low-code/no-code user interfaces so
            that people with little or no background in digital technology or expert data science can create business
            value using data science and machine learning. These platforms also support expert data scientists by also
            offering a more technical interface. Using a multipersona DSML platform encourages collaboration across the
            enterprise.
