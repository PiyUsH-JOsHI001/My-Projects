    <p><b>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)</b> was the first computing system designed in the early
        1940s. It consisted of 18,000 buzzing electronic switches called vacuum tubes, 42 panels each 9'x 2'x1'. It was
        organized in U-Shaped around the perimeter of a room with forced air cooling.
    <ul>
        <li><b> Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)</b> design was known as the first digital electronic computer
        (though not programmable). It was designed and built by John Vincent Atanasoff and his assistant, Clifford E.
        Berry in 1937.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>In 1941, Z3</b> was invented by German inventor Konrad Zuse. It was the first working programmable,
        fully automatic computing machine.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Transistors </b>were invented in 1947 at Bell Laboratories which were a fraction the size of the
        vacuum tubes and consumed less power, but still, the complex circuits were not easy to handle.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b> Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce</b> invented the Integrated Circuit at the same time. In July 1959
        Noyce filed a patent for this.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b> In 1968, Robert Noyce co-founded Intel Electronics company </b>which is still the global market
        leader in IC manufacturing, research, and development.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b> In 1983, Lisa</b> was launched as the first personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI)
        that was sold commercially; it ran on the Motorola 68000, dual floppy disk drives, a 5 MB hard drive and had 1MB
        of RAM.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>In 1990, Apple</b> released the Macintosh Portable; it was heavy weighing 7.3 kg (16 lb) and
        extremely expensive. It was not met with great success and was discontinued only two years later.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>In 1990, Intel </b>introduced the Touchstone Delta supercomputer, which had 512 microprocessors.
        This technological advancement was very significant as it was used as a model for some of the fastest
        multi-processors systems in the world.</li>
