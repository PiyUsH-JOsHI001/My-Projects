        <ul>
            <li> Businesses need inputs (money, materials, machines, men and processes) to convert into products or
                services as output.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>With the same inputs the same output may not be achieved every time and various activities need proper
                direction, coordination and integration.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>The process of using various resources (inputs) to produce results (outputs) is known as management. The
                degree of success varies according to efficiency.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Thus, management refers to the process of using men, money, machines, material and processes through
                proper direction, coordination and integration of several activities to produce desired results.</li>

            and cheapest way’.<br>
