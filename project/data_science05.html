            Enterprises can unlock numerous benefits from data science. Common use cases include process optimization
            through intelligent automation and enhanced targeting and personalization to improve the customer experience
            (CX). However, more specific examples include:

            <br>
            Here are a few representative use cases for data science and artificial intelligence:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An international bank delivers faster loan services with a mobile app using machine learning-powered
                credit risk models and a hybrid cloud computing architecture that is both powerful and secure.</li>
            <li>An electronics firm is developing ultra-powerful 3D-printed sensors to guide tomorrow’s driverless
                vehicles. The solution relies on data science and analytics tools to enhance its real-time object
                detection capabilities.</li>
            <li>A robotic process automation (RPA) solution provider developed a cognitive business process mining
                solution that reduces incident handling times between 15% and 95% for its client companies. The solution
                is trained to understand the content and sentiment of customer emails, directing service teams to
                prioritize those that are most relevant and urgent.</li>
            <li>A digital media technology company created an audience analytics platform that enables its clients to
                see what’s engaging TV audiences as they’re offered a growing range of digital channels. The solution
                employs deep analytics and machine learning to gather real-time insights into viewer behavior.</li>
            <li>An urban police department created statistical incident analysis tools to help officers understand when
                and where to deploy resources in order to prevent crime. The data-driven solution creates reports and
                dashboards to augment situational awareness for field officers.</li>
            <li>Shanghai Changjiang Science and Technology Development used IBM® Watson® technology to build an AI-based
                medical assessment platform that can analyze existing medical records to categorize patients based on
                their risk of experiencing a stroke and that can predict the success rate of different treatment plans.
            </li>
        </ul>
