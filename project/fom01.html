            <li><b>Goal oriented process:</b> Management always aims at achieving the organisational objectives.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Pervasive:</b> Management is universal. It is not restricted to business firms only; it is
                applicable in profit-making, non-profit-making, business or non-business organisations; even a hospital,
                school, club and house has to be managed properly. Concept of management is used in the whole world
                whether it is USA, UK or India.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Multidimensional:</b> Management does not mean one single activity but it includes three main
                activities: i. Management of work ii. Management of people iii. Management of operations</li>
                <br>
            <li><b> Continuous process:</b> Management is a continuous or never ending function. All the functions of
                management are performed continuously.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Group activity:</b> Management always refers to a group of people involved in managerial activities.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Dynamic function:</b> Management has to make changes in goal, objectives and other activities
                according to changes taking place in the environment. Changes in environments need change in
                organisation to survive in the competitive world.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Intangible:</b> Management function cannot be physically seen but its presence can be felt throguh
                orderliness and coordination in the working environment.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Balancing effectiveness and efficiency:</b> Effectiveness means achieving targets and objectives in
                time. Efficiency refers to optimum or best utilisation of resources. Managements always try to balance
                both and get the work done successfully. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Composite process:</b> Management consists of a series of functions which must be performed in a
                proper sequence. These functions are not independent of each other. For example, organising cannot be
                done without planning, or directing cannot be executed without staffing and planning</li>
