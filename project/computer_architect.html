        <p>In general terms, the architecture of a computer system can be considered as a catalogue of tools or
            attributes
            that are visible to the user such as instruction sets, number of bits used for data, addressing techniques,
            etc.
        </p>
        <p>Whereas, Organization of a computer system defines the way system is structured so that all those catalogued
            tools can be used. The significant components of Computer organization are ALU, CPU, memory and memory
            organization.</p>

        <H3>Prerequisite</H3>
        <p>Before learning the concepts of Computer Architecture and Organization, you should have a basic knowledge
            prior
            to Computer Architecture, basic functional units of a computer system, etc.</p>
