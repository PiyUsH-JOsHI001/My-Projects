        <h1 id="Features of C Language">Features of C Language</h1>
        <p> C is the widely used language. It provides many features that are given below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Simple</li>
            <br>
            <li>Machine Independent or Portable</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mid-level programming language</li>
            <br>

            <br>

        <h3>1) Simple</h3>
        <p>C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts),
            the rich set of library functions, data types, etc.</p>

        <h3>2) Machine Independent or Portable</h3>
        <p>Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific
            changes. Therefore, C is a machine independent language.</p>

        <h3>3) Mid-level programming language</h3>
        <p>Although, C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as
            kernel, driver, etc. It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as
            mid-level language.</p>
        <h3>4) Structured programming language</h3>
        C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions.
        So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.

        <h3>5) Rich Library</h3>
        <p>C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.

        <h3>6) Memory Management</h3>
        <p>It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any
            time by calling the free() function.</p>
        <h3>7) Speed</h3>
        <p>The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence
            the lesser overhead.</p>

        <h3>8) Pointer</h3>
        <p>C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can
            use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.</p>

        <h3>9) Recursion</h3>
        <p>In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.
            Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.</p>

        <h3>10) Extensible</h3>
        <p>C language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.</p>
