        <ul>
            <li>Management as a Science</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Science refers to a systematic body of knowledge to understand phenomena and management as a science
                    has (i) cause and effect relationship (ii) principles should be verifiable. (iii) predictable
                    results. (iv) universal application. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Theories and techniques like, PERT and CPM, break even analysis, budgeting etc. are all scientific
                    in nature.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Management as an Art: </li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Management deals with human beings, we cannot predict a definite cause - effect relationship. Hence
                    it is not treated as a pure science.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Art refers to application of skill. It is creative and improves by practice. Art of managing varies
                    from one manager to another with experience.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Thus, management is a combination of both science and art. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Management as Profession: Any occupation is a profession if it has (i) systematic knowledge like
                engineering or chartered accountancy (ii) formal method to acquire knowledge with a degree and
                certificate (iii) association to devise code of conduct for professionals (iv) financial reward should
                not be the main measure of success but to serve the long-run interests of the society. All India

                managers.</li>
