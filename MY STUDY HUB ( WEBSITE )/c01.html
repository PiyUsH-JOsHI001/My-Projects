        <p><b>History of C language</b> is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss a brief history of the c
            language.</p>

        <p><b>C programming language</b> was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American
            Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Dennis Ritchie</b> is known as the <b>founder of the c language.</b></p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.</p>
        <p>Initially, C language was developed to be used in <b>UNIX operating system</b>. It inherits many features of
            previous languages such as B and BCPL.
