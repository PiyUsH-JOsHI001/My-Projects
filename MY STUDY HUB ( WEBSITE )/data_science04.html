            Cloud computing scales data science by providing access to additional processing power, storage, and other
            tools required for data science projects.
            <br>
            <br>

            Since data science frequently leverages large data sets, tools that can scale with the size of the data is
            incredibly important, particularly for time-sensitive projects. Cloud storage solutions, such as data lakes,
            provide access to storage infrastructure, which are capable of ingesting and processing large volumes of
            data with ease. These storage systems provide flexibility to end users, allowing them to spin up large
            clusters as needed. They can also add incremental compute nodes to expedite data processing jobs, allowing
            the business to make short-term tradeoffs for a larger long-term outcome. Cloud platforms typically have
            different pricing models, such a per-use or subscriptions, to meet the needs of their end user—whether they
            are a large enterprise or a small startup.

            Open source technologies are widely used in data science tool sets. When they’re hosted in the cloud, teams
            don’t need to install, configure, maintain, or update them locally. Several cloud providers, including IBM
            Cloud®, also offer prepackaged tool kits that enable data scientists to build models without coding, further
            democratizing access to technology innovations and data insights.
