        <p>
            Henry Fayol evolved 14 general principles of management
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Division of Work:</b> work should be assigned to a person for which he is best suited or specialised.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Authority and Responsibility:</b> Responsibility means the work assigned, and authority means rights
                given to manage.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Discipline:</b> subordinates should respect superiors and obey their orders. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Unity of Command:</b> subordinates should work under the supervision of one superior only. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Unity of Direction:</b> Each group of activities having the same objective must have one head and one
                plan of action. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Scalar Chain:</b> The lines of authority from highest to lowest ranks are known as Scalar Chain. It
                defines the flow of information or communication. If the organisation is bid, the flow of communication
                through the scalar chain may get delayed when two employees at the same level want to exchange
                information. Concept of ‘Gang Plank’ helps to avoid delays and allow direct communication between two
                employees at the same level.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Remuneration:</b> Fair wages to the employees </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Centralisation:</b> There should be a proper balance between centralisation and delegation of
                authority in an organisation. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Order:</b> Proper space should be made available for men and materials. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Equity:</b> being kind and just to workers</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest: </b>collective interest of the organisation
                should be preferred to individual interests.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Initiative:</b> encouraging initiative among its personnel to achieve desired results.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Stability of Tenure:</b> stability and continuity of tenure of employment without frequent
                termination of employees.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Esprit de Corps:</b> Managers should infuse the spirit of teamwork and cooperation among the
                employees.</li>

        </ol>
