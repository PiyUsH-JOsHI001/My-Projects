            Interrelationship of managerial functions </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Dividing job of managing into its elements for in-depth analysis and understanding.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In practice, managers do not neatly divide their job into certain functions</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you ask a manager what exactly he does, probably he will read out a jumble of activities which do not
                easily categorise into a set of functions. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Categorisation is the job of management theorists and not practitioners. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Different experts, including Fayol, developed their own classification of managerial functions. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Generally scholars agree on planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling as the basic
                functions of management.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h4>Organising</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Refers to formal grouping of people and activities to achieve objectives</li>
            <br>
            <li>Organising involves (1) determining activities, (2) grouping activities (3) assigning groups to a
                manager, (4) delegation of authority and (5) provision for coordination through authority and
                information</li>
            <br> horizontally and vertically in the organisation structure. </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h4>Staffing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the process of determining manpower requirements and recruiting persons. </li>

            <br>
            <li>It involves fitting the right person to the right job and developing human resources. </li>

            <br>
            <li>Involves implementation of plans and programmes</li>
            <br>
            <li>It involves leadership, supervision, communication and motivation</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h4>Controlling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Checking, measuring and regulating the on-going activities</li>
            <br>
            <li>Ensuring desired results</li>
            <br>
            <li>Three basic steps in the control process.</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>(i) Establishment of standards: focus on critical variables rather than all variables</li>
            <br>
            <li>(ii) Measurement of performance: may be quantitative goals or qualitative</li>
            <br>
            <li>(iii) Correcting deviations: to pinpoint the occurrence outside the permissible range of action to allow
                management to take corrective action.</li></ul>
