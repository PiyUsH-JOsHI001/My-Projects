        <h3>Development of management thought </h3>
        <p>Manage activities with a large number of people must have been known even in the ancient past. There is
            evidence about the practice of management since early civilizations like construction of the Egyptian
            Pyramids, or the Great Wall of China.
            <br>
            <br>
            Major changes took place with the industrial revolution in the 18th century with large scale factories using
            mechanical power and employing hundreds of people. So the process of management and functions got attention
            from management experts. Thinking of management as a separate field of learning and practice began in the
            19th century.
            <br>
            <br>

            Various approach of viewpoints: Traditional or classical viewpoint (1880-1920): Scientific, Administrative
            and Bureaucratic; Behavioural viewpoint (1920-1940): Human Relations and Behavioural Science; Modern
            viewpoint (1940-) : System, Contingency and Quality
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>F.W. Taylor’s Scientific management:</b> Mainly focused on increasing productive efficiency of individual
            workers. The scientific principles: (i) Development of scientific methods in setting work standards and the
            best way of doing work (ii) Scientific selection and placement of workers best suited to perform the tasks
            and training and development (iii) Clear division of work and responsibility between management and workers
            (iv) Harmonious relations and close cooperation with workmen.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Henri Fayol’s Administrative Theory:</b> In Scientific Management, the role of managers and their
            functions were not given adequate attention. Fayol classified business activities in six areas: (i)
            Technical: production and maintenance (ii) Commercial: buying, selling and exchange (iii) Financial: Capital
            (iv) Security: protection of property and human beings (v) Accounting: of stores and equipment (vi)
            Managerial: planning, organising, commanding, coordinating and control.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Max Weber’s Bureaucratic Theory:</b> The main features (a) Hierarchy of authority: relationship and chain
            of command (b) Division of work: based on competence (c) Policy, rules, and regulations: to ensure
            discipline and control (d) Rule of law: for impersonal behaviour based on position in the hierarchy (e)
            Standardisation of methods, systems, processes (f) Selection and promotion: based on competence (g) Legal
            power: from official position held by individual.
