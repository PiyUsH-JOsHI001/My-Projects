        <h1 id="Data Structures Basic Concepts">Data Structures Basic Concepts</h1>
       <p>This chapter explains the basic terms related to data structure.</p> 

        <h3>Data Definition</h3>
       <p> Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Atomic − </b> should define a single concept.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Traceable − </b> should be able to be mapped to some data element.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Accurate − </b> should be unambiguous.</li>
        <br>

       <li><b> Clear and Concise − </b> should be understandable.</li>
       <br>
    </ul>

       <h3> Data Object</h3>
       <p> Data Object represents an object having a data.</p>

     <h3> Data Type</h3>  
      <p> Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values
        that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that can be performed on the
        corresponding type of data. There are two data types −</p> 
<ul>
       <li> Built-in Data Type</li>
       <br>
       <li> Derived Data Type</li>
    </ul>
       <h3> Built-in Data Type</h3>
      <p>  Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most
        of the languages provide the following built-in data types.</p>
<ul>
       <li> Integers</li>
       <br>
       <li> Boolean (true, false)</li>
       <br>
       <li> Floating (Decimal numbers)</li>
       <br>
       <li> Character and Strings</li>
    </ul>
       <h3> Derived Data Type</h3>
      <p> Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are
        known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data
        types and associated operations on them. For example −</p> 
<ul>
       <li>List</li>
       <br>
       <li>Array</li>
       <br>
       <li>Stack</li>
       <br>
       <li>Queue</li>
       <br>
    </ul>
      <h3> Basic Operations</h3> 
      <p> The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen
        largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.</p> 
<ul>
       <Li> Traversing</Li>
       <br>
       <Li> Searching</Li>
       <br>
       <Li> Insertion</Li>
       <br>
       <Li> Deletion</Li>
       <br>
       <Li> Sorting</Li>
       <br>
       <Li> Merging</Li>
       <br>
    </ul>
